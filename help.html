                <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                <span><span style="color: #269dcf;">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and
                    built by
                    a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

                    <br>
                    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                    limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
                    <span style="color: #269dcf;">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage
                    their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
                    visual interface.

                    <span> <b>Exploring the Board</b> <br>
                        When you log in to <span style="color: #269dcf;">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
                        board represents your project
                        and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span>

                        <b>Creating Contacts</b><br>
                        In <span style="color: #269dcf;">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                        projects.
                        Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information.
                        Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                        board.

                    <span><b>Adding Cards</b><br>
                        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                        tasks.
                        Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                        in the card,
                        like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>

                    <span><b>Adding Cards</b><br>
                        Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                        Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a
                        new card.
                        Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                        etc.</span>

                    <span><b>Deleting Cards</b><br>
                        Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                        Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                        cards,
                        as this action is irreversible. <br>
