            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <span><span style="color: #269dcf;">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
                 a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                <br>
                <br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                 limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
                 <span style="color: #269dcf;">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
                   visual interface.
                <br>
                <br>

                    and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span>

                    like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>

                <span><b>Deleting Cards</b><br>

                    as this action is irreversible. <br>
